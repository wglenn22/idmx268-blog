Today I chose to review an introductory tutorial article on node.js by web developer WebDEasy. I chose this article because I wanted to dive a little deeper into node.js, which is one thing this article does very well. Node.js is defined in this article in a way that is very clear and concise. Node.js allows JavaScript to be used for server-side programming, when previously it was mainly used for frontend web development. He explains Node.js can be used to develop small CLI tools to complex programs, and HTTP servers. It is this versatility, the “onboard resources” and our acquaintance the NPM (node package manager) that gives Node.js its niche. He even teaches you how to install it on Windows and Mac, and even walks you through your first project. Although I would recommend trying something more complex for a first project, like trying to configure Gatsby to be used with node this project would be great for those of us without any guidance.
